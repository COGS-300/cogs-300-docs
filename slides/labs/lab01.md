# Welcome to the COGS 300 Lab
The COGS 300 Lab is available for you to use during the day (7:00am - 9:00pm). You are welcome to claim a shelf with your team, use a black lock box, and use the equipment.

# Lab Rules

1. **Clean up after yourself.** Clean up _more_ than what you used. What goes around comes around. Ensure your table is totally clear.
2. **Turn everything off.** Ensure everything (i.e., lights, soldering iron, etc.) is _off_ and _cold_ before you leave.
3. **Sweep and remove trash**. If there is trash in the trash box, take it out. Waste sorting is around the corner from Chris and Colleen's office.

# Safety Procedures

<style scoped>section{font-size:30px;}</style>

1. Soldering must be only done on the soldering table.
2. The charcoal filter fan must be running while you solder.
3. Familiarize yourself with the location of the fire extinguisher.
4. Familiarize yourself with the exit routes.
5. Unplug anything that starts to get hot, produce smoke, or smell bad.


You are working with live electricity. Although the Arduino's 5V output is not enough to damage you, it can damage your computer or Arduino. Do not plug anything in unless you are _certain_ that it is safe. Be particularly certain of anything that plugs into the wall. _Wall power can kill you._

# Equipment rules

1. All tools are to remain in the COGS lab. No exceptions.
2. Robot parts are allowed to be borrowed, but must be signed out.
3. Return all parts that you have borrowed and sign them back in.
4. Do not borrow more than you absolutely need. 
5. If you need something for more than a week, buy it.
